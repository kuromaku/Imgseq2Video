A GUI written in scala which can be used to create videos (needs ffmpeg) from image sequences
(.jpg files)..
The program currently only works properly on Linux since it uses certain system commands.

The most basic usage scenario involves a sequence of images with names like image_0001.jpg,
image_0002.jpg and so forth which the GUI will pass to ffmpeg in order to make the video
(currently using pre-determined parameter values).
However, it should also be able to process several such sequences at once if you open files
using the button "OpenManySequences" and then for example choose a directory containing
several indexed sequences. The program can create either several separate video files or
concatenate the image sequences into one single video.

You can also normalize an indexed sequence like image_0021.jpg,image_0022.jpg to a sequence
like image_0001.jpg,image_0002.jpg using the button "normalizeSequence" and make loops.
