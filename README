A GUI written in scala which can be used to create videos (needs ffmpeg) from image sequences (.jpg files).The program currently only works properly on Linux since it uses certain system commands.

The most basic usage scenario involves a sequence of images with names like image_0001.jpg, image_0002.jpg and so forth which the GUI will pass to ffmpeg in order to make the video (currently using pre-determined parameter values). However, it should also be able to process several such sequences at once if you open files
using the button "OpenManySequences" and then for example choose a directory containing several indexed sequences. The program can create either several separate video files or concatenate the image sequences into one single video.

If you load several indexed sequences and then click "Make Movie", the program will create a different video file from each indexed sequence at the same time which can be very taxing to the CPU. However, if you select "Create a single movie" from the menu it will first make a single indexed sequence from the different sequences (into the tmp folder) and then it creates a single movie.

You can also normalize an indexed sequence like image_0021.jpg,image_0022.jpg to a sequence like image_0001.jpg,image_0002.jpg using the button "normalizeSequence" and you can also make loops.

To use the software from command line try "java -jar dist/Imgseq2Video.jar"

Beware: The software is in development state and has not been carefully tested to ensure sane behavior in all circumstances.
